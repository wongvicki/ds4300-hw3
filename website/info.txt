Style and Design Choices:
- I chose a lavender theme for my website, choosing different shades for the headers/footers, background, and header text.
- For my navigation bar, I made the font color white and upon hovering, the text is underlined.
- The layout is centered.
- Images are a reasonable size - small enough to not completely obstruct the text, but large enough to see clearly.
- Images have rounded edges.
