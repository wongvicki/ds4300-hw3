      Hi! My name is Vicki, and Iâ€™m a third year at Northeastern studying data science and behavioral neuroscience. 
      I'm from the Bay Area, California and Honolulu, Hawai'i. 
      I've previously worked in Information Security at Intel, computational neuroscience research at Harvard/Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and did my first co-op at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. 
      I'll be moving to New York City soon for my second co-op at Regeneron, where I'll be working on the same medicines that changed my life after battling chronic illness since childhood.
      Have fun exploring my interests through this website!
